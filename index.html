        <h1>Play Audio and Play Video</h1>
        <p>
            This is an application where you can add one or more of your favorite songs or videos that you want to watch. The application is designed based on Python's Pygame and Tkinter libraries. It allows you to adjust the volume when playing audio, skip tracks if you wish, you can fast forward to the part of the song you want, and finally, you can pause the audio when needed.
